Dataset_used_for_the_iMetaLab_paper:

The original dataset was published in Li, L., et al., RapidAIM: a culture- and metaproteomics-based Rapid Assay of Individual Microbiome responses to drugs. Microbiome, 2020. 8(1):33.
We took the technical triplicats of diclofenac vs control raw files and performed database search using MetaLab Desktop (V2.2)  (accessible through https://iMetaLab.ca).
Raw files were seached against the IGC database using default settings of closed search. 
The search results are uploaded in this repository.
